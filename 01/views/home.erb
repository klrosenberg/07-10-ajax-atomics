<ol>
  <li>Why are you able to make requests to **/info1** and **/info2** even though there are no route handlers for those paths defined in **app.rb**?</li>
  <p>The files /info1 and /info2 are in the public file.</p>
  
  <li>Why is the XHR object's request path **/info1** instead of **/public/info1**?</li>
  <p>The public folder is the default path for Sinatra.</p>
  
  <li>Within the `addEventListener` function, what does `this` represent?</li>
  <p>'This' refers to the variable req, which is what the event listener is listening for (the response of 'this' being loaded.)</p>
